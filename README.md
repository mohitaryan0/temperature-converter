# temperature-converter
A simple temperature converter web application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
The Temperature Converter is a web-based tool that allows users to convert temperatures between Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin. It provides a user-friendly interface where users can enter a temperature value and select the units they want to convert from and to. Upon clicking the "Convert" button, the application performs the conversion and displays the result dynamically.

This project demonstrates the use of HTML for structuring the web page, CSS for styling and layout, and JavaScript for handling user interactions and performing the temperature conversion calculations.
